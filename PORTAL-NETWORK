*Use case

Users visit the site.
By default, there are 10 different virtual pets available and users can choose their own pets.
Other unique pets must be purchased at the user's market.
Users can feed their pets in a virtual space, take a walk together, and enjoy fun together.
By doing so, users can overcome loneliness and gain a sense of accomplishment by seeing how their pet grows.
It can also be used as a companion animal education material for the owner before the sale of puppies and other animals. By doing so, when selling virtual pets among users, the seller can preview and sell the characteristics of the buyer in advance.
